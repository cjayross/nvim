# Neovim Config

Configuration comes with key mappings, LSP, Treesitter, and Fennel support via
[hotpot](https://github.com/rktjmp/hotpot.nvim).

Using ssh, which is necessary for fetching submodules, the config can be cloned
directly into your `.config/` directory using:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:cjayross/nvim
```

In addition, make sure you also install the base
[.vim](https://github.com/cjayross/.vim) configuration.
